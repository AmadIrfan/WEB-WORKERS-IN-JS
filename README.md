| **Project Name  ** | **LARGE API DATA SORTING** |

###***Description:***

This web application fetch product data from API using fetch method and store in array with both `web workers` and `without web workers`. When application runs, it asks user to load API sorted data with `postId` By Clicking on buttons of web workers or with out web workers. if you select to load data with web workers it will take less time to load and sort data.After loading data loading time will show in a textbox and data from API will appear on webpage in tabular form.

Basic goal of app is to implement `web works `is to increase speed of our web page.

#### How to run project :

1. **Clone Project Repository : **

   Clone a project repository from GITHUB to your local system.

2. **Start a Local Server : **

   open root folder of web app in vs code and press `f5`or `f10` to run project locally. 

   ####Summary on findings :

   using `web workers`  I fetch data From APIs and Sort it more fast then with out web workers. web works are efficient to use but have many disadvantages. Web workers have `onmessage` or `postmessage` method to perform any task.

   #### Challenges faced:

   Using `WEB WERKERS` I faced issue of `page not responding` . more my chrome is taking more `CPU power and consuming memory` .
